# Web Scrapper

This is an web scrapper build using python.And several modules like sqlite3,requests and beautifulSoup is been used to complete this project.

The website that I used in the project is 'TheVerge.com',which is an news publishing website.

In this project the basic details of an article like published date, author and title is been fetched and stored in an sqlite database using sqlite3 python module.And before stored in the database each and every article is been interpreted as an object using the Article_data class.

Finally the database can be downloaded as an csv file.
