# Web Scrapper

This is an web scrapper build using python.

This web Scrapper is build on top of request,beautifulSoup.

The website I used to scrap is 'TheVerge.com'  an news website.

In this project the basic details of an article like published date, author and title is been fetched and stored in an sqlite database using sqlite3 python module.

And finally the database can be downloaded as an csv file.
